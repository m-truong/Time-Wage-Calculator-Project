### Motivation:
Sometimes we need a little perspective on how much material things are actually worth. Everywhere we go, we are bombarded with advertisements, marketing strategies, and even gimmicks to convince us to buy more things. But if you're an average American that depends on hourly minimum wages to make a living, it's important to consider how much time you spent making that “hard-earned” money… just to purchase the things we enjoy and depend on. 

It's extremely useful to know how you value your own time. If you can figure out how much money each extra hour is worth to you, it'll help you make smarter decisions about your lifestyle habits, including: 

* Whether to take on additional part-time work, and at what rate. 
* Whether you should try to scale down your hours at your current job. 
* How long you should wait in line for a free item. 
* Whether taking a cab is worth the extra cost. 
* Whether it's worth it to hire a personal assistant, a laundry service, or other help. 

Is it worth it?

### Project Summary:

So this is our concept: how much are things really worth? 

In our society, many Americans earn hourly wages and it’s so engrained into our society that it’s not even extreme to say that a Starbucks coffee ($4) is worth about 16 minutes of a person’s time who earns ($15/hr the new minimum wage). 

I think it can also show the privilege of people who earn higher wages in that it is worth such a small amount of time it’s almost negligible, like say someone who earns $13.4 million an hour (Jeff Bezos).

This mobile application is a "time wage calculator" to help raise awareness for the FightFor15 movement to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25/hr to $15.00/hr.  or determining how much time from you life it costs to work and earn a material item (before taxes).

### Features:
The conversion from decimal to time was done using the following formula: 
[Decimal to time calculator https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/time/decimal-to-time-calculator.php]

1. How much you make hourly? H 
2. How much you make salary? S - calculates to hourly 
3. How much the item is? M 

$4/$15 = 0.266 hrs x 60 min/1hr = 16 min 0 seconds 
$4/$13,000,000 = 0.001 seconds 1ms

## Issues and Resolutions

#### List of Errors.....

**ERROR**:
1. error Failed to build iOS project. “xcodebuild” command error code 65
2. Issues using the 'pod install' command in terminal.

**RESOLUTION**:
1. It was caused by installing react-native-vector-icons and linking by running the react-native link react-native-vector-icons command. I had to unlink react-native vector-icons to successfully build the iOS app.
