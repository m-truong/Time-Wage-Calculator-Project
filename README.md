# Time-Wage Calculator

### Motivation:
Sometimes we need a little perspective on how much material things are actually worth. They are worth more than money, they are also worth our time spent making that “hard-earned” money… that is if you’re an average American that depends on hourly wages to live. 

It's extremely useful to know how you value your own time. If you can figure out how much money each extra hour is worth to you, it'll help you make smarter decisions about many subjects, including: 

* Whether to take on additional part-time work, and at what rate. 
* Whether you should try to scale down your hours at your current job. 
* How long you should wait in line for a free item. 
* Whether taking a cab is worth the extra cost. 
* Whether it's worth it to hire a personal assistant, a laundry service, or other help. 

1. How much you make hourly? H 
Or 
2. How much you make salary? S - calculates to hourly 
3. How much the item is? M 
$4/$15 = 0.266 hrs x 60 min/1hr = 16 min 0 seconds 
$4/$13,000,000 = 0.001 seconds 1ms 

Is it worth it?

### Project Summary:

So this is our concept: how much are things really worth? In our society, many Americans earn hourly wages and it’s so engrained into our society that it’s not even extreme to say that a Starbucks coffee ($4) is worth about 16 minutes of a person’s time who earns ($15/hr the new minimum wage). I think it can also show the privilege of people who earn higher wages in that it is worth such a small amount of time it’s almost negligible. like say someone who earns $13.4 million an hour (Jeff Bezos).

This mobile application is a "time-wage calculator" for determining how much time from you life it costs to work and earn a material item (before taxes).

## Issues and Resolutions

#### List of Errors.....

**ERROR**:
1. error Failed to build iOS project. “xcodebuild” command error code 65

**RESOLUTION**:
1. It was caused by installing react-native-vector-icons and linking by running the react-native link react-native-vector-icons command. I had to unlink react-native vector-icons to successfully build the iOS app.
